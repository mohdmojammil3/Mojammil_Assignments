    "# Ans-The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model real-world entities and their interactions in a way that promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code. It is a programming paradigm that organizes data and code into objects, which are instances of classes. Each class represents a blueprint or template that defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) of the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The main objectives of OOP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Encapsulation: OOP allows data and methods that operate on the data to be bundled together within a single unit called an object. This concept of bundling data and methods is known as encapsulation. It helps in hiding the internal implementation details of an object from the outside world, promoting data security and ensuring that changes to the internal representation of an object do not affect other parts of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Abstraction: Abstraction enables programmers to define the essential characteristics of an object while hiding the irrelevant details. It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, making the code more manageable and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse, as common attributes and methods can be defined in a superclass and utilized by multiple subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows methods to be written to handle objects of a generic type, which can then be used to handle objects of specific types during runtime. This enables flexible and extensible code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overall, OOP aims to create a structured and organized approach to software development, making it easier to design, develop, and maintain complex applications by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable objects with clear relationships and behaviors."

Each object has a unique identity, a type that determines its behavior, and can be accessed using dot notation for attributes and methods.
