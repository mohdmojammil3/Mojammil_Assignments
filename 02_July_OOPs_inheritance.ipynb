    "# Ans- Inheritance in object-oriented programming allows a subclass to inherit properties and behaviors from a superclass. It promotes code reusability, hierarchy, and organization by defining shared functionality in a base class and letting other classes inherit and extend it. Inherited attributes and methods can be used as is in subclasses, which reduces code duplication and makes the code more maintainable and extensible. Inheritance is a fundamental concept used to create structured and scalable codebases, enhancing flexibility and promoting polymorphism."
